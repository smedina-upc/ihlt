# Chunking

#### Statement

* Use Machine Learning to build a chunker by learning sequences following next constraints:

  1. Design your own feature set to represent samples

  2. Use CRF as main algorithm

  3. Use Conll2000 corpora as training data

**Note**: see the nltk documentation about classifier-based NP chunkers:
