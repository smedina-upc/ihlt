# Language identification

How to build a language identifier (example guide):

* Preprocess:

  - Remove all the digits from data

  - Convert all the texts to lower case

  - Replace continuous white spaces by a single one

  - Concatenate all sentences with a double space in between

* Use character trigrams as language model (section 4.2 of Jurafsky’s book).

* Use Laplace smoothing technique to avoid zero counts (section 4.5.1 of Jurafsky’s book).

* Remove all trigrams that occurs less than 5 times in training corpus.

* Note: string and regular expression python libraries are useful.

# Language Identification

#### Resources

* [langId.zip](resources/langId.zip)

#### Statement

* Implement a language identifier for the European languages: 

  - English, Spanish, Dutch, German, Italian & French.

* Use [wortschatz leipzig corpora](http://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/en/download): <br>
  - 30k sentences of each of the 6 languages as training set
  -  10k of each as test set.

* Use the guide of previous slides. 

* Give the accuracy and confusion matrix on the test set as result.

* learning time: 13:29.425

* test time: 2:31.334

* accuracy: 0.9989
