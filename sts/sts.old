## SemEval 2012

*SemEval* (Semantic Evaluation Exercises) are a series of workshops which have
the main aim of the evaluation and comparison of semantic analysis systems.
The data and corpora provided by them have become a ’de facto’ set of bench-
marks for the NLP comunity.

The *SemEval* event provides data and evaluation frameworks for several
tasks. One of them is *Semantic Textual Similarity* (STS), the purpose of this
project. 

* All information of 2012’s edition is available at: <br>
[https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2012/](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2012/)

* All information of **6th task (Sematic Textual Similarity)** is available at: <br>
[https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2012/task6/index.html](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2012/task6/index.html)

## Paraphrases

STS is also known as paraphrases detection. A pair of texts is a paraphrase
when both texts describe the same meaning with different words.
Real example extracted from trial data set of above task:

* `The bird is bathing in the sink.`

* `Birdie is washing itself in the water basin.`

## Labels

When doing paraphrases detection on a pair of texts, a similarity value should
be provided. The following table shows the meaning that this label must have
in this task:

| label | description  |
|:------|:-------------|
| 5     | They are completely equivalent, as they mean the same thing. |
| 4     | They are mostly equivalent, but some unimportant details differ. |
| 3     | They are roughly equivalent, but some important information differs/missing. |
| 2     | They are not equivalent, but share some details. |
| 1     | They are not equivalent, but are on the same topic. |
| 0     | They are on different topics. |

## Data

* All the data involved in the task is available at the data page: <br>
[https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2012/task6/index.php%3Fid=data.html](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2012/task6/index.php%3Fid=data.html)<br>
No other source data is allowed.

* It consists of four files:

  - [*trial*](resources/trial.tgz) : includes the definition of the scores, a sample of 5 sentence pairs and the input and output formats. It is not needed, but it is useful for prototyping.

  - [*train*](resources/train.tgz) : training data from paraphrasing data sets, input and output formats.

  - [*test*](resources/test-gold.tgz) : test data from paraphrasing data sets.

  - [*All system submissions*](resources/task6-submissions.tgz) : submissions of the participants.

## Evaluation Measure

* In this task, pearson correlation is used for comparison purposes. It is available in python through the scipy module: <br>
`from scipy.stats import pearsonr` <br>
`pearsonr(refs, tsts)[0]`

## 2012 Results

* At the following addresses, a summary of the results of the competition could
be found:

## Statement

* Use data set and description of task Semantic Textual Similarity in SemEval 2012.

* Implement some approaches to detect paraphrase using sentence similarity
metrics.
  - Explore some lexical dimensions.
  - Explore the syntactic dimension alone.
  - Explore the combination of both previous.

* Add new components at your choice (optional).

* Already generated word or sentence embeddings models are not allowed, such as BERT.

* Compare and comment the results achieved by these approaches among them and among the official results.

* Send files to raco in IHLT STS Project before the oral presentation:
  - Jupyter notebook: `sts-[Student1]-[Student2].ipynb`

  - Slides: `sts-[Student1]-[Student2].pdf`

## Project Evaluation

The project evaluation will be:

```
ProjectGrade = 0.3 ∗ Result + 
               0.2 ∗ Presentation + 
               0.3 ∗ Analysis + 
               0.2 * Code
```

where the Result will be constrained by rules in next table:

| value | constraint |
|:------|------------|
| 10    | if the pearson is over 10th participant (.7562) |
| 0     | if the pearson is under the baseline (.311) |
| proportional | in other case |
