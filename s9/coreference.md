# Coreference in spaCy

### Requirements

```python3
!pip install spacy-experimental
!pip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-experimental/releases/download/v0.6.1/en_coreference_web_trf-3.4.0a2-py3-none-any.whl

import spacy
```

### Use

```python3
doc = nlp(u'My sister has a dog. She loves him.')

doc.spans
ðŸ‘‰  {'coref_clusters_1': [My sister, She], 'coref_clusters_2': [a dog, him]}
```

### spaCy pipeline

See [spaCy documentation](https://spacy.io/api/coref/) for including it in the spaCy pipeline.

# Exercise

* Consider the first paragraph in Aliceâ€™s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll:
```
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, 
and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her 
sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, â€˜and what 
is the use of a book,â€™ thought Alice â€˜without pictures or conversations?â€™
```

* Apply the spaCy coreference solver to the previous paragraph.

* Show the coreference chains. 

* What do you think about them? Justify your answer.
